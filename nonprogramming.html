  <h1>Hardware Project</h1>

  <h2 class="question">Reflection</h2>
  <h3>In this project, I learned how hardware components interact with each other, specifically the printing process. I learnt how printers interact with computers and how the components inside a computer work together to complete the simple task of printing. I still have lots to learn about the network process, as I did not focus heavily on that.</h3>
  <h2>Responses</h2>
  <h2 class="question">Question One</h2>
  <h3>Question - How might this hardware project have improved your understanding of computer components? Explain using an example of hardware component(s).</h3>
  <h3>Answer - Prior to this assignment, I knew components interacted together but not really how. After conducting the necessary research to finish my assignment according to the instructions, I understood how they worked together. I also learnt more about components such as the graphcis card, which I now understood has components such as the RAMDAC.</h3>
  <h2 class="question">Question Two</h2>
  <h3>Question - For new students coming into this course, what advice would you give them regarding this particular project?</h3>
  <h3>Answer - Take your time and don't expect the answer to be clear. You will likely feel frustrated that the answer isn't on Google right away, but the process you need to undergo to finish this project is very rewarding and really teaches you a lot about hardware.</h3>

  <h2 class="question">Reflection</h2>
  <h3>This project allowed me to learn about a growing field in the world of Computer Science: Industrial Robotics. I was able to learn what the field focuses on, the growth in the past years and potentional growth in the future, specific jobs in the industry, what they gain, requirementes for these jobs, and more. I still have lots to learn, though. For example, I don't know much about jobs in the field, as for my project, 
 I only focused on two occupations, those being Robotic Engineering and Mechanical Engineering</h3>
  <h2>Responses</h2>
  <h2 class="question">Question One</h2>
  <h3>Question - In the next 5-10 years there will be new jobs that are available and jobs that will disappear. Knowing what you have learned from the assignment, how might you best prepare yourself for the future workforce?</h3>
  <h3>Answer - Personally, I am not going into a field like this. However, if I was, I know what degrees I will need to enter, so I will know what high school courses I must focus on, which universities are better than others for this field, and the potentional growth for this field. All this information gives me a sligth advantage over other students and knowing the potentional growth allows me to plan accordingly.</h3>
  <h2 class="question">Question Two</h2>
  <h3>Question - Q2. Computing will most likely be part of every job in the future, what skills can you transfer from this course into your future profession?</h3>
  <h3>While not all jobs will directly require coding, all fields will become dependant on it due to to software. Other than that, learning computer science at a young age trains the human brain to work with and understand computer systems much faster. For example, a young adult with comp-sci experience will be able to troubleshoot an issue with their computer within minutes, while an elderly person who has not had much experience with computer will likely need help to figure it out.</h3>
  <h2 class="question">Question Three</h2>
  <h3>Question - In preparation for post-secondary life, what is the one thing about yourself regarding learning skills that you would like to work to improve? Explain your reasoning.</h3>
  <h3>Answer - Personally, I would like to and likely will need to improve my independant-work skills. I find it hard to work on a project outside the comfort of my own home, which will need to change in the following months.</h3>
  <h1>Emerging Technologies</h1>

  <h2 class="question">Reflection</h2>
  <h3>I chose to focus on RFID as an emerging technology for this assignment. Through my research, I was able to learn how RFID is used today, how it works, its effectiveness, and how it could be used in the future. One example of RFID today is Tap-To-Pay on bank cards. I still have more to learn about RFID, such as how to apply this technology today.</h3>
  <h2>Responses</h2>
  <h2 class="question">Question One</h2>
  <h3>Question - If your emerging technology were fully realized today, how might life be different?</h3>
  <h3>Answer - RFID would make life much more convinient and efficient. People will no longer have to stop at checkpoints such as store checkout, airport security, or border patrol, and instead can walk through and have the RFID system automatically identify them and go through with the required process. While privacy may be an issue, many people would enjoy the efficiency brought along by this technology.</h3>
  <h2 class="question">Question Two</h2>
  <h3>Question - If you were sent back in time 1000 years, how might you explain your emerging technology to the locals?</h3>
  <h3>I would explain RFID as a living being that has hyper-senses, allowing it to detect things the locals might find useful at the time. They could use this 'being' to find out when vulnurable products such as dairy or meats have spoiled without having to check themselves.</h3>
  <h2 class="question">Question Three</h2>
  <h3>Question - How might future technology not negatively impact the natural environment?</h3>
  <h3>Answer - RFID itself cannot negativley impact the environment, due to how it works. RFID is simply a way of transferring information wirelessly. The production process of RFID could harm the environment by releasing greenhouse gasses, but that is simply the fault of the industrial process and not the technology.</h3>

  <h2 class="question">Reflection</h2>
  <h3>For this project, my group had to research support groups and programs that would aid students in non-traditional computer science jobs. Through our research, we discovered many occupations we didn't even know existed at the time. Surprisingly, we went through no challenges. We all worked co-operativley and even met up at the library to work together. We had no issues with the work we were assigned because it was all equal.</h3>
  <h1>File Backup and Organization</h1>
  <h3>This project showed me the basics of file organization in the industry. This is a necessary skill which anyone working with computers must use to make sure they don't lose any data or time. In addition, I like to have files from the past to look back on with a nostalgic lens, so I take organization seriously. Due to all these factors, I will be completeing organization and backup simolar to this project in the future.</h3>
  <h1>Post-Course Work</h1>
  <h3>In the first week of the course, we had to write a letter to our teacher explaining how we will work towards getting an A. I set expectations for myself to always complete my work on-time and even early to avoid stress, improve my skills and research more about computer science jobs. I was able to meet all these expectations and achieve a level 4 in the end.</h3>
